    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     14
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        14
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   565 out of   1,430   39%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       764 out of   2,860   26%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,856
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,354 out of   1,856   72%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of   1,856    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         500 out of   1,856   26%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              22 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
